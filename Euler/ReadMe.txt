Binary tree
	Search DFS
	Search BFS
	Preorder
	Postorder
	Inorder
	Height of tree
	Visit edges
	Iterative pre/post order
	Kadane's algorithm - max subsequence of array

Graphs:
	Minimum spanning tree
	Topological sort
	Dykstra shortest path

Segment tree - range query in an array. Minimum between two points in array? Sum in range, max in range. Normally O(n2) + O(1) for search. 
but segment trees are O(n) to build matrix and O(logn) to query

Sorting
	Quick sort
	Radix sort
	Merge sort
	American flag sort

Dynamic programming
	
N Queens
	Diagnoal search Left diagonal = Row - Column,  Right diagonal = Row + Column

Search a 2d space using  binary search:
	Use a 2x2 array with x0,y0,x1,y1 rectangle. 1/2 each area

	suffix strings
	prefix strings
